                    gene regulatory patterns underlying vertebrate brain development. Amy received a Bachelor’s
                    degree in
                    Natural Sciences and Mathematics from Bard College and a Ph.D. in Genetics and Biophysics from
                    the
                    University of Colorado, where
                    she studied the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases involved in signal transduction and
                    control of cell
                    growth. Her research interests include the use of cutting edge molecular and genetic approaches
                    to explore
                    the transcriptional
                    basis of neuronal diversity and investigation of structure-function relationships in brain
                    development. Amy

                <strong>Speaker:</strong>
                <span>Kunal Ghosh, Ph.D., Inscopix. </span><strong>(Confirmed)</strong> <br>
                <strong>Bio:</strong>
                <span>Kunal Ghosh is founder and CEO of Inscopix, Inc., a Palo Alto-based startup developing a
                    platform for mapping brain circuits. Kunal founded Inscopix out of a research project at
                    Stanford University that resulted in the invention of a miniature, integrated microscope
                    for in vivo brain imaging. The invention is the centerpiece of Inscopix's core brain circuit
                    mapping products which today have already advanced fundamental knowledge of the
                    brain circuits underpinning brain function and behavior. Inscopix's platform also has the
                    potential of shaping the future of neuro-therapeutic discovery, enabling the development
                    of entirely new in vivo circuit-based assays for diseases such as Parkinson's, epilepsy, and
                    depression. Kunal is a passionate advocate of the role of business as a force for good in
                    society, and especially the role of entrepreneurial ventures in catalyzing a technologyfueled
                    revolution in
                    brain science and mental health. He is a frequent speaker on these
                    themes at scientific meetings, industry conferences, and top Business schools, and serves
                    on the World Economic Forum's Council on Neurotechnologies and Brain Science. Kunal
                    holds a BSE in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania, a BS from the
                    Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, and an MS and PhD in Electrical
                    Engineering from Stanford University.

                <strong>Speaker:</strong>
                <span>Lee Rubin, Professor, Harvard University. </span><strong>(Confirmed)</strong> <br>
                <strong>Bio:</strong>
                <span>Lee Rubin investigates the key molecular mediators of different neurodegenerative
                    diseases, with the ultimate goal of finding effective preclinical therapeutic candidates. His
                    research group discovered that a circulating protein, GDF11, has the ability to reverse
                    some of the changes in the CNS associated with aging. They are actively exploring the
                    therapeutic implications of these observations. Dr. Rubin received his Ph.D. in
                    Neuroscience from the Rockefeller University and completed postdoctoral fellowships in
                    Pharmacology from Harvard Medical School and in Neurobiology from Stanford
                    University School of Medicine. He has a broad experience in both academia and industry,
                    particularly in the realms of cell-based assays and drug discovery. Prior to coming to
                    Harvard, Rubin was Chief Scientific Officer of Curis, Inc., a Cambridge-based
                    biotechnology company, where his group identified the first small molecule regulators of
                    the hedgehog signaling pathway. One of their antagonists was developed by Genentech
                    and is now (as Erivedge) approved as the first oral treatment for metastatic basal cell
                    carcinoma.

                <strong>Speaker:</strong>
                <span>Winfried Wiegrabe, Ph.D., Allen Institute. </span><strong>(Tentative)</strong> <br>
                <strong>Bio:</strong>
                <span>Dr. Wiegrabe is the Director of Microscopy & Image Analysis at the Allen Institute. All his
                    professional life, Winfried has used, programmed, and built microscopes. He worked in
                    industry and academia, in Germany and the US. Winfried received his diploma in
                    Biophysics and Machine Tools and Industrial Management from the Technical University
                    in Munich, Germany. For his diploma and Ph.D. thesis he joined the Department of
                    Molecular Structural Biology headed by Wolfgang Baumeister at the Max-Planck Institute
                    for Biochemistry in Martinsried, Germany. Under the mentorship of Reinhard ‘Guckus’
                    Guckenberger, Winfried investigated hydrated bacterial surface proteins with scanning
                    tunneling microscopy (STM). He developed an atomic force microscope (AFM) to
                    measure their conductivity. He complemented this data with measurements of their local
                    elasticity and friction. For a short post-doc, he joined the group of Eberhard Unger at the
                    Institute for Molecular Biology in Jena, Germany. He applied low current STM to hydrated
                    microtubules. Being in Jena, where Carl Zeiss founded his microscopy company and Ernst
                    Abbe worked out the theory of the light microscope and its resolution limit, Winfried
                    headed a R&D team at Carl Zeiss to develop a product based on the discoveries of Eric
                    Betzig, the scanning near field optical microscope (SNOM) to overcome this limit. Later,
                    he became world-wide product manager for fluorescence correlation microscopy (FCS),
                    a method that can measure the concentration, diffusion properties, and molecular
                    interactions of proteins within living cells. In 2001, Winfried joined the Carl Zeiss group
                    in the USA and helped customers to be successful users of confocal and two-photon
                    microscopes (NLO), as well as FCS. In 2005, Winfried moved back to academia and joined
                    the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, Missouri, USA. He created the
                    group for Advanced Instrumentation and Physics and became later the Head of the
                    Stowers Microscopy Center. In this capacity he supported and built with his team a large
                    variety of microscope techniques, from laser micro-dissection to super-resolution
                    techniques and light sheet microscopy. He developed technology to automatically
                    perform FCS measurements on 4000 different proteins in yeast.
