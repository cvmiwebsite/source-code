				<strong>Title:</strong>
				<span> Computer Vision Opportunities for Shape Analysis from EM Connectomics Data</span>
				<br/>
				<strong>Start Time: </strong><span>9:15 AM PDT</span><br>
			    <strong>Speaker: </strong>
			    <span>Sharmishtaa Seshamani, Ph.D., Allen Institute for Brain Science</span><br>
			    <strong>Abstract: </strong>
				<span>The field of connectomics aims to map the morphology and synaptic connectivity 
				of all neurons in a brain region. Understanding the detailed wiring patterns of the 
				brain is of fundamental interest not only in neurobiology, but also for novel 
				biological-inspired architectures in artificial intelligence. Electron Microscopy 
				(EM) makes it possible to densely label diverse biological objects across more than 
				five orders of magnitude in size, from synapses and cellular organelles tens or 
				hundreds of nanometers wide to neuronal arbors more than a millimeter long in datasets
				 containing tens of thousands of neurons. The current largest EM image datasets are
				  on the petabyte scale, including the entire fruit fly brain and a cubic millimeter
				   of a mouse visual cortex.<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to assemble and analyze such large scale image data relies heavily 
				on advances in computer vision, such as image registration to assemble 3D image 
				volumes, segmentation to extract neuronal morphology and shape analysis to describe 
				neurons of different cell types. We present our efforts towards building such a 
				dataset which includes tissue processing, volume assembly and information extraction. 
				We have recently released a public dataset of the mouse visual cortex (layer 2/3) and 
				are currently actively pursuing several types of analysis of this data for studying 
				connectivity and morphological cell typing.</span>

			        <strong>Title:</strong><span>Immunological Synapse Quality Predicts the Efficacy/Toxicity of CAR Immunotherapy</span></br>
					<strong>Start Time:</strong><span>10 AM PDT</span></br>
					<strong>Speaker:</strong>
			        <span>Dongfang Liu, Associate Professor, Rutgers University- New Jersey Medical School.</span> <br>
			        <strong>Abstract:</strong>
					<span>
						 Human immune system consists of a network of billions of independent, self-organized cells that 
						 interact with each other to form a highest intelligence. Artificial intelligence (AI) is being 
						 used in immunological research. Machine learning (ML) is an AI tool that can process huge data 
						 and generate models for immune system and immunological research. One of the most exciting, recent 
						 breakthroughs in immunological research is cancer immunotherapy. Specifically, one such therapy 
						 involves engineering immune cells to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), which combine tumor
						  antigen specificity with immune cell activation in a single receptor. Recent clinical trials testing
						   cancer immunotherapies have shown promising results for treating various cancers. The adoptive 
						   transfer of these CAR-modified immune cells (especially T-cells, CAR T) into patients has shown 
						   remarkable success in treating multiple refractory blood cancers. To improve their efficacy and 
						   to expand their applicability to other cancer types, scientists are optimizing different CARs 
						   with different modifications. However, predicting and ranking the efficacy of different CAR T 
						   cell products with identical antigen specificity, selection of responders with an identical CAR
							T construct, and identification of the optimal CAR for a translation researcher to further develop 
							potential clinical application are limited by the current, time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive
							 conventional tools used to evaluate efficacy. Particularly, T cell efficacy is not only controlled 
							 by the specificity and avidity of the tumor antigen and T cell interaction, but also it depends on
							  a collective process, involving multiple adhesion and regulatory molecules, spatially organized at 
							  the T cell immunological synapse (IS). Optimal function of cytotoxic lymphocytes depends on IS 
							  quality. Recognizing the inadequacy of conventional tools and importance of IS in T cell functions, 
							  we investigate a new strategy for assessing CAR T efficacy. Previous studies in our lab show evidence
							   that: 1) CAR T-cell immunological synapse (IS) quality (structure, function, and signaling) varies
								between CAR T-cells, 2) CAR co-stimulatory endodomains influence IS quality, 3) CAR T IS quality 
								correlates with antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo, and 4) CAR IS quality assay developed 
								here can distinguish a responder from non-responders. However, current IS quality image data 
								analysis was quantified manually, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive with low accuracy.
								 Here we develop a machine learning method to quantify thousands of synapse images with enhanced 
								 accuracy. The ML-based, automated algorithms to quantify CAR T IS can develop fast and easy tools
								  to predict CAR T cell efficacy, which provides guidelines for designing and optimizing CARs for
								   clinical cell therapy.

				<strong>Title:</strong><span>Algorithms and Tools to Analyze Multi-Modal Brain Imaging Data</span></br>

				<strong>Abstract:</strong>
				<span>
					Decoding the brain is a grand challenge that will require innovations in both brain recording tools 
				and in algorithms for extraction of signals from brain data. Traditional electrode-based recording tools
				 do not have the cell type-specificity or the scale to capture the individual activity of a large number 
				 of genetically-targeted neurons, key to mapping the patterns of neural activity that give rise to behavior.
				  Fluorescence microscopy, a workhorse tool for the life sciences, has emerged as a powerful modality to 
				  record brain activity with cellular resolution, cell-type specificity and at scale. Recent advances 
				  in head-mounted miniaturized fluorescence microscopes, or "miniscopes", now enable imaging activity 
				  from thousands of neurons during behavior and longitudinally over time, providing neuroscientists with
				   unprecedented data sets of the brain circuits implicated in learning, memory formation, sensory 
				   processes, and in brain disease.<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new data sets are rich in information about how the brain works, and how it does not, but are 
				of little use if the information cannot be efficiently, reliably and accurately extracted. In this 
				talk we will present methods to extract electricity from pixels, and methods and tools to analyze 
				large brain imaging data. In the first part of the talk we will show how individual time traces of 
				the activity of each neuron imaged can be extracted from terabytes of miniscope brain data, and in
				 the second part of the talk we will present MIRA, a Multimodality Image Registration and Analysis
				  toolbox, that enables integrating and co-registering functional miniscope neural imaging data with 
				  high-resolution microscopy data to help researchers map the brain.</span>

                    platform for mapping brain circuits. Kunal founded Inscopix out of a research project at
                    Stanford University that resulted in the invention of a miniature, integrated microscope
                    for in vivo brain imaging. The invention is the centerpiece of Inscopix's core brain circuit
                    mapping products which today have already advanced fundamental knowledge of the
                    brain circuits underpinning brain function and behavior. Inscopix's platform also has the
                    potential of shaping the future of neuro-therapeutic discovery, enabling the development
                    of entirely new in vivo circuit-based assays for diseases such as Parkinson's, epilepsy, and
                    depression. Kunal is a passionate advocate of the role of business as a force for good in

				<strong>Title:</strong><span>Creating a Landscape of Cellular Signatures through Quantitative Live Cell Imaging</span></br>
				<strong>Start Time:</strong><span>3:15 PM PDT</span></br>
                <strong>Speaker:</strong>
                <span>Winfried Wiegraebe, Ph.D., Director of Microscopy, Allen Institute for Cell Science. </span><br>
                <strong>Abstract:</strong>
				<span>To build predictive models of the human cell, we develop tools to create quantitative and 
				reproducible data sets. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) are healthy diploid cells 
				which can differentiate into almost any cell type of the human body. They have a normal karyotype
				 unlike many currently used cell lines. We created stable cell lines that express green fluorescence
				  protein (eGFP) fused to proteins at their endogenous locus. The fluorescence intensity of these 
				  fusion proteins is proportional to their abundance.<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We established specialized imaging pipelines based on spinning disk microscopes optimized for 
					throughput and point-scanning confocal microscopes with detectors that achieve an optical resolution 
					beyond the classical diffraction limit. We are adding lattice light sheet microscopy to our toolbox 
					for fast and long-term time lapse imaging. To ensure reproducibility, we developed software to automate 
					imaging pipelines.<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will present a workflow to calibrate the intensity between different microscope modalities and to
					 estimate the absolute concentration of a given protein. We created a dilution series of eGFP solutions 
					 in the physiological relevant range from nM to M. We measured the concentrations with fluorescence
					  correlation spectroscopy (FCS). Then we imaged the eGFP solutions with the same microscopes under 
					  identical settings as used for cell imaging. We created a concentration/intensity calibration curve 
					  that we applied to microscope images of cells to obtain the concentration of eGFP labeled protein. 
					  For most cell lines we inserted eGFP only into one allele. Quantitative Western Blots allowed us
					   to estimate the ratio between labeled and unlabeled proteins in the cells. Using this ratio, we 
					   could estimate the total concentration of a given protein within life cells (labeled and un-labeled 
					   protein).<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We developed a toolbox to segment cellular structures. The extracted features create a landscape of 
					cellular signatures that can be explored through our Cell Feature Explorer and are used as input for
					 quantitative modelling. We believe in open science, and thus all of our cell lines, data sets, and 
					 tools are available at https://www.allencell.org.</span>

                <span>Dr. Wiegrabe is the Director of Microscopy & Image Analysis at the Allen Institute. All his
                    professional life, Winfried has used, programmed, and built microscopes. He worked in
                    industry and academia, in Germany and the US. Winfried received his diploma in
                    Biophysics and Machine Tools and Industrial Management from the Technical University
                    in Munich, Germany. For his diploma and Ph.D. thesis he joined the Department of
                    Molecular Structural Biology headed by Wolfgang Baumeister at the Max-Planck Institute
                    for Biochemistry in Martinsried, Germany. Under the mentorship of Reinhard ‘Guckus’
                    Guckenberger, Winfried investigated hydrated bacterial surface proteins with scanning
                    tunneling microscopy (STM). He developed an atomic force microscope (AFM) to
                    measure their conductivity. He complemented this data with measurements of their local
                    elasticity and friction. For a short post-doc, he joined the group of Eberhard Unger at the
                    Institute for Molecular Biology in Jena, Germany. He applied low current STM to hydrated
                    microtubules. Being in Jena, where Carl Zeiss founded his microscopy company and Ernst
                    Abbe worked out the theory of the light microscope and its resolution limit, Winfried
                    headed a R&D team at Carl Zeiss to develop a product based on the discoveries of Eric
                    Betzig, the scanning near field optical microscope (SNOM) to overcome this limit. Later,
                    he became world-wide product manager for fluorescence correlation microscopy (FCS),
                    a method that can measure the concentration, diffusion properties, and molecular
                    interactions of proteins within living cells. In 2001, Winfried joined the Carl Zeiss group
                    in the USA and helped customers to be successful users of confocal and two-photon
                    microscopes (NLO), as well as FCS. In 2005, Winfried moved back to academia and joined
                    the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, Missouri, USA. He created the
                    group for Advanced Instrumentation and Physics and became later the Head of the
                    Stowers Microscopy Center. In this capacity he supported and built with his team a large
                    variety of microscope techniques, from laser micro-dissection to super-resolution
                    techniques and light sheet microscopy. He developed technology to automatically
                    perform FCS measurements on 4000 different proteins in yeast.
